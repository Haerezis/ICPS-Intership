\section*{Introduction}
\addtocontents{toc}{\protect\contentsline{section}{Introduction}{}}
Many computation-intensive programs spend a very large amount of their execution
time inside nested loops. Thus, loop nest optimization is one of the major approach used
for program optimisation.

To represent the loop nest, you can use the Polyhedral Model, a powerful mathematical model
that allows to express loop nest as union of polytopes and loop optimizations as
transformation of these polytopes.

The game is to find the "good" polytope transformations to end up with
transformed polytopes representing loop nest (which doesn't violate dependences) 
that can be parallelized, vectorized, tiled, etc. if with the original loop nest you couldn't.

The Polyhedral Model is really good with short and simple codes, but struggle with
large and complex codes.
%TODO : pourquoi ? (reformuler en évitant de copier le sujet de stage...)

We would like to address these issues by proposing a new technique : before any
high-level optimizations are used on the source code, a first pass is applied (our pass),
aggregating "near behaving" statements together using their profile.
"Near behaving" statements describe statements that have similar properties,
like data reuse/locality, parallelism, vectorization etc. that constitute their profile.

\section*{General Informations}

    In this report, several things should be noted :
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Arrays used in code example are always in Row-major layout.
        \item Code example are either in C or pseudo-code.
    \end{itemize}

\section{Polyhedral Model}
The polyhedral model is (as explained in \cite{Bas'12}) a mathematical model that allows to represent program
part as union of polytopes and affine sets. Program parts that can fit the model
are called \textit{static control parts} or \textit{SCoPs} for short.
Scops are generally loop-based, and need to have affine loop bounds, conditions and
array subscripts to fit the polyhedral model.

The polyhedral model consist of three mathematical objects based on unions of relations :
\begin{itemize}
    \item The \textit{Iteration Domain}, that provide the set of all the iteration scanned
        %parcouru
        by a specific statement, using affine constraints. It's these affine constraints 
        that can be seen as a $\mathbb{Z}$-polytope.
    \item The \textit{Scattering Relations} (or \textit{Scheduling Relations},
        or even\textit{Mapping Relations}), that give us the ordering which
        all the statement instances will be executed.
    \item The \textit{Access Relations} that model read/write accesses made by
        the different arrays and simple variables.
\end{itemize}

    \subsection{Iteration Domain}
        To understand Iteration Domain, you must first understand what a \textit{statement instance}
        is. A statement instance is one particular execution of a statement.
        When a statement is located inside a loop nest, it can be associated to the value
        of the outer-loop counters (called \textit{iterators}.
        The Iteration Domain will be the set of the iterators of all the statement
        instance.

        Because the outer loop bound can be affine or parameterized, it is generally impossible to
        know their actual value at compilation time. Even if we knew the value of the
        bounds, the number of iterators could be to enormous to count them all into sets.
        That's why the sets are expressed as a system of affine constraints.
        These affine constraints define a $\mathbb{Z}$-polyhedron, hence the name of the model.
        The relation used to represent the Iteration Domain is :
        \begin{center}
            $ \mathcal{D}_S(\vec{p}) = \left\{() \to \vec{\imath_S} \in \mathbb{Z}^{\dim(\vec{\imath_S})}
            \middle|
            \left[D_S\right]\begin{pmatrix}\vec{\imath} \\ \vec{p} \\ 1\end{pmatrix}
            \geq \vec{0}
            \right\}$
        \end{center}
        where $\vec{\imath}$ is the $\dim(\vec{imath})$-dimensional iteration vector and
        $D_S \in \mathbb{Z}^{m_{\mathcal{D}_S} \times (\dim(\vec{\imath})+\dim(\vec{p})+1)}$
        is an integer matrix where $m_{\mathcal{D}_S}$ is the number of constraints.
        \\

\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single, language=C, caption={Simple code for polyhedral model example}, label={lst:polyhedral_example}]
        for(i=0 ; i<2*N - 1 ; i++)
S1:         A[i] = 42;
        for(i=0 ; i<N ; i++)
            for(j=0 ; j<N ; j++)
S2:             B[i][j] += 42;
\end{lstlisting}
        
        For example, in Listing~\ref{lst:polyhedral_example}, we have for
        S1 and S2 the iteration domain :
        \begin{itemize}
            \item[]$ \mathcal{D}_{S1}(N) = \left\{() \to \begin{bmatrix}i\end{bmatrix} \in \mathbb{Z} \middle|
            \left[\begin{array}{c:c:c}
                    1 & 0 & 0 \\
                    -1 & 2 & -2
            \end{array}\right]
            \left(\begin{array}{c}
                    i \\ \hdashline
                    N \\ \hdashline
                    1 
            \end{array}\right)
            \geq \vec{0}
            \right\} $,
        
            \item[]$ \mathcal{D}_{S2}(N) = \left\{() \to \begin{bmatrix}i\end{bmatrix} \in \mathbb{Z} \middle|
            \left[\begin{array}{c:c:c:c}
                    1 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
                    -1 & 0 & 1 & -1\\
                    0 & 1 & 0 & 0\\
                    0 & -1 & 1 & -1
            \end{array}\right]
            \left(\begin{array}{c}
                    i \\
                    j \\ \hdashline
                    N \\ \hdashline
                    1 
            \end{array}\right)
            \geq \vec{0}
            \right\} $.
        \end{itemize}

        In the case of \textit{if-then-else} enclosed statements, the iteration domain
        for the statement will be an union of disjoint polytope, each representing a part
        of the \textit{if-then-else} condition.

    \subsection{Scattering Relations}
        Defining the domain of iteration is great, but it doesn't give us any information
        on the order in which will be executed each statement instance.

        There is different type of ordering relations :
        \begin{description}
            \item[Scheduling] is about ordering the statement instances in time by
                giving them a logical date vector indicating when each will be executed.
                The data vector is generally read in \textit{lexicographically} order, for example
                $(1,2,3)$ is executed before $(1,2,4)$ but after $(1,1,4)$.
            \item[Allocation] or \textbf{placement} is about ordering statement instances
                in space by assigning to each statement instances a logical stamp
                indicating the processor number in which it will be executed.
                Statement instances not sharing the same logical stamp can be
                executed in parallel in different processor.
        \end{description}

        It is possible to express each ordering relations as separate relation,
        but it is also possible to aggregating them together : the result would be
        a relation between the iterators set and a set of ordering vector which
        would have some dimensions allocated to time ordering (scheduling) and
        some other to space ordering (allocation).

        For a statement $S$, the scattering relation can be written as follow :
        \begin{center}
            $\theta_S(\vec{p}) = \left\{\vec{\imath_S} \to \vec{t_S} \in \mathbb{Z}^{\dim(\vec{\imath_S})}\times\mathbb{Z}^{\dim(\vec{t_S})}
            \middle|
            \left[T_S\right]\begin{pmatrix}\vec{t_S}\\ \vec{\imath} \\ \vec{p} \\ 1\end{pmatrix}
            \geq \vec{0}
            \right\}$,
        \end{center}
        where $\vec{\imath}$ is the $\dim(\vec{\imath})$-dimensional iteration vector
        and $T_S \in \mathbb{Z}^{m_{\theta_S}\times(\dim(\vec{\imath_S})+\dim(\vec{t_S})+\dim(\vec{p})+1)}$
        is an integer matrix where $m_{\theta_S}$ is the number of constraints.

        For example, for Listing~\ref{lst:polyhedral_example}, we have for S1 and S2
        statement the original scattering of the program :
        \begin{itemize}
            \item[]
                $\theta_{S1}(N) = \left\{(i) \to \begin{pmatrix}t^{1}_{S1}\\t^{2}_{S1}\\t^{3}_{S1}\end{pmatrix} \in
                    \mathbb{Z}\times\mathbb{Z}^{3}
                    \middle|
                    \left[\begin{array}{ccc:c:c:c}
                            -1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
                            0 & -1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 
                            0 & 0 & -1 & 0 & 0 & 0
                    \end{array}\right]
                    \left(\begin{array}{c}
                        t^{1}_{S1} \\
                        t^{2}_{S1} \\
                        t^{3}_{S1} \\ \hdashline
                        i \\ \hdashline
                        N \\ \hdashline
                        1
                    \end{array}\right)
                    = \vec{0}
                    \right\}$,\\
                    which can be simplify to $\theta_{S1}(N)(i)=\begin{pmatrix}0\\i\\0\end{pmatrix}$.
            \item[]
                $\theta_{S2}(N) = \left\{(i) \to \begin{pmatrix}t^{1}_{S2}\\t^{2}_{S2}\\t^{3}_{S2}\\t^{4}_{S2}\\t^{5}_{S2}\end{pmatrix} \in
                    \mathbb{Z}\times\mathbb{Z}^{3}
                    \middle|
                    \left[\begin{array}{ccccc:cc:c:c}
                            -1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1\\
                            0 & -1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0\\ 
                            0 & 0 & -1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
                            0 & 0 & 0 & -1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0\\ 
                            0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & -1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0
                    \end{array}\right]
                    \left(\begin{array}{c}
                        t^{1}_{S2} \\
                        t^{2}_{S2} \\
                        t^{3}_{S2} \\
                        t^{4}_{S2} \\
                        t^{5}_{S2} \\ \hdashline
                        i \\ \hdashline
                        N \\ \hdashline
                        1
                    \end{array}\right)
                    = \vec{0}
                    \right\}$,\\
                    which can be simplify to $\theta_{S2}(N)\begin{pmatrix}i\\j\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}0\\i\\0\\j\\0\end{pmatrix}$.
        \end{itemize}
        The first dimension for S1 is 0 and for S2 is 1 : it is to ensure that S2
        is always executed after S1.
        In our example, it doesn't matter because S1 and S2 doesn't have any dependence
        whatsoever, and they could be run in parallel without problem, but for the sake
        of the example, we've imposed that S1 is executed before S2.

    \subsection{Access Relations}
        The \textit{Access Relations} models the memory access of the different
        array references in a statement. It map the statement instances to memory locations
        for every array reference in the statement. Non-array reference can be seen as
        0-dimensional array.

        The access relation can be written in the general form :
        \begin{center}
            $\mathcal{A}_{S,r}(\vec{p}) = 
            \left\{
                \vec{\imath_S} \to \vec{a}_{S,r} \in \mathbb{Z}^{\dim(\vec{\imath_S})}\times\mathbb{Z}^{\dim(\vec{a}_{S,r})}
                \middle|
                \left[A_{S,r}\right]\left(\begin{array}{c}\vec{a}_{S,r}\\\vec{\imath_S}\\\vec{p}\\1\end{array}\right)
                \geq \vec{0}
            \right\}$
        \end{center}
        where 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item $r$ is the number of the reference in the statement (every references are
                numbered, from left to right generally),
            \item $\vec{\imath}$ is the $\dim(\vec{\imath})$-dimensional iteration vector
            \item $T_S \in \mathbb{Z}^{m_{\theta_S}\times(\dim(\vec{\imath_S})+\dim(\vec{t_S})+\dim(\vec{p})+1)}$
                is an integer matrix where $m_{\theta_S}$ is the number of constraints.
        \end{itemize}

        The read or write nature of the memory access is not expressed in this form,
        and need to be given (for example, to compute dependences).

        For example, for Listing~\ref{lst:polyhedral_example}, we have for S1 and S1 the
        access relation :
        \begin{itemize}
            \item[]
                $
                \mathcal{A}_{S1,1}(N) = 
                \left\{
                \begin{pmatrix}i\end{pmatrix} \to \left(a_{S1,1}\right) \in \mathbb{Z}\times\mathbb{Z}
                    \middle|
                    \left[\begin{array}{c:c:c:c}-1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \end{array}\right]
                    \left(\begin{array}{c}a_{S1,1}\\\hdashline i\\\hdashline N\\\hdashline 1\end{array}\right)
                    = \vec{0}
                \right\}
                $
            
            \item[]
                $
                \mathcal{A}_{S2,1}(N) = 
                \left\{
                \begin{pmatrix}i\end{pmatrix} \to \left(a_{S2,1}\right) \in \mathbb{Z}\times\mathbb{Z}
                    \middle|
                    \left[\begin{array}{c:c:c:c:c}-1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \end{array}\right]
                    \left(\begin{array}{c}a_{S2,1}\\\hdashline i\\\hdashline j\\\hdashline N\\\hdashline 1\end{array}\right)
                    = \vec{0}
                \right\}
                $
        \end{itemize}

        Because S1 and S2 only have one reference, there's only one access relation for
        each of them.

%    \subsubsection{Data Dependences}
%            We can say that if there is no dependences between two statements, there
%            is no reuse possible between them.
%            %TODO

    \subsection{OpenScop Framework}
        OpenScop~\cite{openscop} is an open specification that define a file format
        and a set of data structures to represent a static control part (SCoP).

        OpenScop format is intended to be a stable bridge between polyhedral tools
        and optimizers allowing interchangeable tools and flexible toolchains.

        A library named \textit{osl} is provided to read/write OpenScop files
        and manipulate the different data structures the specification define.
        The file format as well as the library has been designed to accept extensions.

        The tool performing our optimization pass uses OpenScop as input and output
        format.

\section{Statement Profiling}
    \subsection{Data Reuse/Locality}
        In this section, we will explain the basics behind data reuse/locality and
        then talk about the different metrics and methods found in the literature used to evaluate
        and quantifying data reuse and why they where selected or not for the statements profile.

        %Le problème étant que dans notre cas, seul la quantification de reuse nous intéresse
        %la locality étant lié au scattering, il nous intéresse moins.

        \subsubsection{Difference between Reuse and Locality}
            It's important to differentiate \textit{reuse} from \textit{locality}.
            We say that there is \textit{reuse} for a data when this data is
            access multiple time during the execution of a loop nest, during
            the same iteration or not. It can be from different references or different statements.
            
            When there is reuse, it's possible (but not guaranteed) to have
            \textit{locality}. We say that there is \textit{locality} when the
            reused data remains in memory hierarchy level targeted 
            (eg : the CPU cache in our case) between 2 reuses.
            For that to be the case, the amount of other data accessed between the
            2 reuses must not exceed the cache size, or else the reused data will be
            evicted from the cache, causing a cache miss and forcing the cache
            to fetch the data from the RAM (and RAM have higher latency compared to CPU cache).


            Thus, we can say that the \textit{reuse} is linked to the way indexing
            functions (for array references) are written, whereas \textit{locality} is
            inherent to the iterations order/the way the loops are written.

        \subsubsection{Types of Reuse}
            
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single, language=C, caption=Reuse example, label={lst:reuse_example}]
for(i=0; i<N ; i++)
    for(j=0; j<N ; j++)
    {
        A[i][j] = B[i] + B[i+1];
        C[i][j] = B[i+2] * 2;
    }
\end{lstlisting}

            \paragraph{Self-Temporal}
                Self-Temporal reuse occurs when the same reference access the same
                data location.
                
                For example, in Listing \ref{lst:reuse_example}, the reference \verb'B[i]' carry Self-Temporal
                reuse :\verb'B[0]',\verb'B[1]',\verb'B[2]' ... \verb'B[N-1]' are accessed
                \textit{j} times by the same reference \verb'B[i]'.
                And for the same reason, \verb'B[i+1]' and \verb'B[i+2]' also carry Self-Temporal reuse.

            \paragraph{Self-Spatial}
                Self-Spatial reuse occurs when the same reference access the same
                line in an array (when in row-major). Especially, the space between
                two accessed data location should not be greater than a cache line size,
                or else there won't be any spatial locality.

                For example, in Listing \ref{lst:reuse_example}, the reference \verb'A[i][j]' carry
                Self-Spatial reuse.

                Self-Temporal reuse can be considered as a special case of
                Self-Spatial reuse : accessing the same data location mean that
                the same array line is also accessed.
            \paragraph{Group-Temporal}
                Group-Temporal reuse occurs when different references access the same
                data location. It can occur inside a same statement or across different
                statements.

                For example, in Listing \ref{lst:reuse_example}, the reference
                \verb'B[i]', \verb'B[i+1]' and \verb'B[i+2]' carry Group-Temporal :
                the data accessed by \verb'B[i+2]' when $i=M$ will be access by
                \verb'B[i+1]' when $i=M+1$ and by \verb'B[i]' when $i=M+2$.

            \paragraph{Group-Spatial}
                Group-Spatial reuse occurs when different references access the same
                line in an array (when in row-major). Again, the space between
                two accessed data location should not be greater than a cache line size,
                or else there won't be any spatial locality.
                
                For example, in Listing \ref{lst:reuse_example}, the reference
                \verb'B[i]', \verb'B[i+1]' and \verb'B[i+2]' carry Group-Spatial :
                they all access to different data location, but on the same line.\\
                \\

                So as you can see, a single reference can carry multiple type of reuse.
                A statement being generally composed of multiple references, it 
                can be hard to automatically favor some statements instead of others.
        \subsubsection{Reuse Vector Space}
            The notion of Reuse Vector Space come from Wolf et. al.\cite{Wolf'91} and describe
            the vector subspace of the Iteration vector space where the reuse of
            a reference can be taken advantage to induce locality.
            There is as many reuse vector space as there is type of reuse.

\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single, language=C, caption=Simple example, label={lst:simple_example}]
for(i=0; i<N ; i++)
    for(j=0; j<N ; j++)
    {
        f(A[i], A[j]);
    }
\end{lstlisting}

            For example, in Listing \ref{lst:simple_example}, with the Iteration
            space being spanned by $\{(1,0),(0,1)\}$, the self-spatial reuse vector space of
            \verb'A[i]' is $\{(1,0)\}$ (ie the {\it i} loop), and the one of \verb'A[j]' is $\{(0,1)\}$
            (ie the {\it j} loop).

            Wolf et. al. use the concept of uniformly generated references proposed
            by Gannon et. al.\cite{Gannon:1988:SCL:50454.50460} for estimating reference
            windows :
            \begin{defn}
            \label{sec:uniformly_generated}
                Let $n$ be the depth of a loop nest, and $d$ be the dimensionality of
                an array $A$. Two references $A[\vec{f}(\vec{\imath})]$ and
                $A[\vec{g}(\vec{\imath})]$, where $\vec{f}$ and $\vec{g}$ are indexing
                functions $Z^{n} \rightarrow Z^{n}$, are called \textbf{uniformly generated} if :
                \begin{center}
                    $\vec{f}(\vec{\imath}) = H\vec{\imath}+\vec{c}_f$ and $\vec{g}(\vec{\imath}) = H\vec{\imath}+\vec{c}_g$
                \end{center}
                where $H$ is a linear transformation and $\vec{c}_f$ and $\vec{c}_g$ are constant vectors.
            \end{defn}
            
            We can partition references into equivalence class, called \textit{uniformly generated sets},
            when the references operate on the same array, and have the same $H$.
            You can see $H$ as a part of one of the access function (in the Polyhedral Model representation) of this statement :
            it's the access function matrix without the part handling the constant vector.

            For example in Listing \ref{lst:reuse_example}, $B[i]$,$B[i+1]$ and $B[i+2]$ can be each written as
            \begin{center}
                $
                \begin{bmatrix}
                    1 & 0
                \end{bmatrix}
                \begin{bmatrix}
                    i\\
                    j
                \end{bmatrix}
                +
                \begin{bmatrix}
                    0
                \end{bmatrix}
                $,\\
                $
                \begin{bmatrix}
                    1 & 0
                \end{bmatrix}
                \begin{bmatrix}
                    i\\
                    j
                \end{bmatrix}
                +
                \begin{bmatrix}
                    1
                \end{bmatrix}
                $,\\
                $
                \begin{bmatrix}
                    1 & 0
                \end{bmatrix}
                \begin{bmatrix}
                    i\\
                    j
                \end{bmatrix}
                +
                \begin{bmatrix}
                    2
                \end{bmatrix}
                $.
            \end{center}
            As you can see, all these reference share the same $H=\begin{bmatrix}1 & 0\end{bmatrix}$,
            so they all belong to the same class.\\
            Of course, $B[i]$,$B[i+1]$ and $B[i+2]$ belong to different statement, and in
            our pass, a uniformly generated set would be created for each statement.

            The problem with that method, is that it would put the references
            $C[i][j],C[i][j+1],C[i-1][j]$ in the same class : they all share the
            same $H$, but they don't have the same reuse space at all.
            For example : $C[i][j],C[i-1][j]$ exhibit group-spatial reuse in the $i$ dimension,
            whereas $C[i][j],C[i][j+1]$ exhibit group-spatial reuse in the $j$ dimension. So they
            should not be group together in the same class.
            \medskip

            So the definition of the \textit{uniformly generated set} is not restrictive enough,
            and in out case, we propose an addition to it : for two references $A$ and
            $B$ (as expressed in Definition~\ref{sec:uniformly_generated}) to be in the same class :
            \begin{itemize}
                \item They need to have the same $H$.
                \item with $\vec{c}=\vec{c_g} - \vec{c_f}$, $\vec{c}$ need to have $0$
                    for all the elements of the vector \textbf{except one}.
            \end{itemize}

            %TODO clarifier les choses, et peut être au lieu de mentionner les méthodes
            %de Wolf, les expliquer içi.

            The reuse spaces would then be computed for each type of reuse
            with the methods described in~\cite{Wolf'91} : statements where
            array references share the same reuse space should be aggregated (if
            it doesn't violate any data dependence).



        \subsubsection{The Simple Algorithm}
            The \textit{Simple Algorithm}~\cite{Kennedy94maximizingloop} is a
            optimization algorithm that improve data locality via Loop Fusion.
            The idea is to fusion vertices of a directed graph when these vertices
            are connected by non-fusion-preventing arcs.
            In this graph, the vertices represent the different loop nests of a program part,
            and the arcs represent data dependences between statements of different loop nests.

            If the dependence is fusion-preventing~\cite{Bacon:1994:CTH:197405.197406} or if the loop headers are incompatible,
            the arc representing the dependence will be marked fusion-preventing.

            The algorithm is a modification of the greedy algorithm that partition
            the nodes of the graph without sequentializing a parallel node/loop, and
            is the following (directly taken from~\cite{Kennedy94maximizingloop}:
            \medskip

            ``  In the greedy partition graph, if there exists two partitions $g_1$
                and $g_2$ with a directed edge $(g_1,g_2)$, then no node in $g_2$
                may be legally placed in $g_1$ or the greedy algorithm would have put it
                there. However, it may be safe and profitable to move nodes in $g_1$
                down into $g_2$.

                We determine if it is safe and profitable to move $n \in g_l$ down
                into another partition $g_h$ as follows.
                \begin{description}
                    \item [Safety.] A node $n \in g_l$ may move to $g_h$ \textit{iff} it
                        has no successors in $g_l$ and there is no fusion-preventing
                        edge $(n,r)$ such that $r \in g_h$ or $r \in g_k$ where
                        $g_k$ must precede $g_h$.
                    \item [Profitability.] Compute a sum of edges $(m,n), m \in g_l$
                        and a sum for each $g_h$ of edges $(n,p)$ such that $p \in g_h$
                        and $n$ may be safely moved into $g_h$. Pick the partition
                        $g$ with the biggest sum. If $g \neq g_l$, move $n$ down into $g$.''
                \end{description}
            \bigskip
            
            This algorithm doesn't give us any metric or way to evaluate a statement
            reuse, so it doesn't help use for the reuse evaluation side, but the idea
            of a dependence graph based greedy algorithm is interesting : with statement
            instead of loop nest being the nodes, this kind of greedy algorithm 
            could fusion statements that are inside different loop nest in the SCoP.
            It means we would also need to redefine the \textbf{Safety} and \textbf{Profitability}
            notions of the algorithm.

        \subsubsection{Data and Loop Transformations}
            An algorithm that transforms a loop nest to improve cache locality
            by a combination of loop and data transformations is presented in~\cite{Kandemir99improvingcache}.

            There's not much to say about it. The goal of the algorithm is to
            compute a transformation matrix and array layout (and the explanation is a little
            vague), so it isn't applicable in our case and it doesn't give us any metric or way to evaluate the reuse.
        
        \subsubsection{LoopCost Algorithms}
            The LoopCost algorithm~\cite{McKinley:1996:IDL:233561.233564} provide
            us with a cost model that allow to guide some loop transformation like
            loop permutation, loop reversal, loop fusion, loop distribution,
            by comparing the cost with and without the transformation.
            
            The LoopCost algorithm work like this : 
            Each loop $l$ in a loop nest is considered as a candidate for the innermost
            position in the nest. For each loop $l$, LoopCost compute and sum the number
            of cache line access by a group of references (the groups are formed
            using the RefGroup algorithm) when $l$ is placed as the innermost loop.

            As a result, you have a cost for each loop when they are considered as innermost.
            This cost enable to possibility to compare with hard numbers
            a loop nest before and after some loop transformations, which allow to discard
            or apply the transformations if the new cost is worse or better than the
            original cost.
            \bigskip

            Because the LoopCost is loop transformation oriented and because it doesn't
            use the number of references in a reference group in the computation
            of the cost, it is not really applicable at our situation.
            %TODO remove next paragraph? 
            But if we could change a little the algorithm to add the number of
            references during the computation of the cost, maybe it would be the
            solution to decide if 2 statements are aggregated when they share
            some reuse properties but not all.

            Regarding the RefGroup algorithm that partition the array references
            in group, the criteria used are like the ones for \textit{uniformly generated set}
            but a little more restrictive, so we won't need it.
            
            
        \subsubsection{Automatic Polyhedral Parallelization and Locality Optimization Algorithm}
            Let $S_i$ and $S_j$ two statement of a program with a data dependence $e$
            from $S_i$ to $S_j$.\\
            Let $\vec{s}$ and $\vec{s}$ the iterators of respectively $S_i$ and $S_j$.\\
            Let $\theta_{S_i}$ and $\theta_{S_j}$ the scattering function of respectively $S_i$
            and $S_j$.\\
            Consider the following affine $\delta_e$ :
            \begin{center}
                $\delta_e\left(\vec{s},\vec{t}\right) = \theta_{S_j}\left(\vec{t}\right) - \theta_{S_i}\left(\vec{s}\right)$
            \end{center}

            According to the paper~\cite{Bondhugula:2008:PAP:1379022.1375595},
            the affine form $\delta_e\left(\vec{s},\vec{t}\right)$ is very significant
            because it gives us ``the number of hyperplanes the dependence $e$ traverses
            along the hyperplane normal $\theta$. If $\theta$ is used as a space loop to generate tiles
            for parallelization, this function is a factor in the communication
            volume. On the other hand, if $\theta$ is used as a sequential loop, it
            gives us a measure of the reuse distance.''

            If there is a upper bound to $\delta_e\left(\vec{s},\vec{t}\right)$,
            minimize it (or even nullify it), would be the same as minimizing (or nullify)
            the number of hyperplanes that would be communicated as a result of
            the dependence at the tile boundaries.

            The problem is that minimizing $\delta_e\left(\vec{s},\vec{t}\right)$
            can be really difficult because it ends up in an objective non-linear
            in loop variables and hyperplane coefficients.

            We can avoid this problem if we use a bounding function $v(\vec{p}) = u.\vec{p} + w$ such that :
            \begin{center}
                $\delta_e\left(\vec{s},\vec{t}\right) \leq v(\vec{p})$
            \end{center}
            i.e.,
            \begin{center}
                $v(\vec{p}) - \delta_e\left(\vec{s},\vec{t}\right) \geq 0$
            \end{center}

            With this last inequality, we can apply the Farkas Lemma :
            \begin{center}
                $v(\vec{p}) - \delta_e\left(\vec{s},\vec{t}\right) \equiv \lambda_{e0}
                + \sum\limits_{k=1}^{m_e}{\lambda_{ek}\mathcal{P}_{e}^k},\qquad \lambda_{ek} \geq 0$
            \end{center}
            where $P_e^k$ is a face of $P_e$.

            From this new form, you can get a linear equality and inequality system,
            which can then be handled by PIP software to find minimal solution to it.

            This algorithm doesn't give us any metric or way to evaluate reuse, so
            we can't use it.
